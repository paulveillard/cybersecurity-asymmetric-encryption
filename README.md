## About Asymetric Encryption

Public-key cryptography, or [asymmetric cryptography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public-key_cryptography), is a cryptographic system that uses pairs of keys. Each pair consists of a public key (which may be known to others) and a private key (which may not be known by anyone except the owner)
